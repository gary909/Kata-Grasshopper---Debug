        Debug celsius converter<br>
        <br>
        Your friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a program to convert <br>
        fahrenheit to celsius. Unfortunately his code has some bugs.<br>
<br>
        Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.<br>
<br>
        To convert fahrenheit to celsius:<br>
<br>
        celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)<br>
        Remember that typically temperatures in the current weather conditions are given <br>
        in whole numbers. It is possible for temperature sensors to report temperatures<br> 
        with a higher accuracy such as to the nearest tenth. Instrument error though makes <br>
        this sort of accuracy unreliable for many types of temperature measuring sensors.<br>
